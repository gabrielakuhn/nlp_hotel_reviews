1, a fun adventure. Perfect facilities available while there. I also enjoy stunning views. Beautiful views to shoulder the sunset. Will recommended to friend to go their when the were a holiday timr to enjoy every moment there             
2, As an extended family  we went for a two night retreat at Resorts World tourist hotel over the Christmas weekend and stayed at tourist for the first night. It was very spacious and clean.
3, Booked this hotel for the 3rd time in 4 years and it doesnt disappoint. The rooms are spacious and clean  and facilities are good. It is centrally located in tourist hotel so its very accessible. Will definitely return again.            
4, Came here for short break. The stay was quite present  hotel staff were friendly and helpful. Cooling and nice weather; the mall is renovated with lots more shops and eateries  rather convenient. A little pity that the theme park is still under construction.           
5, Check in process was quick and smooth  with friendly and welcoming Front Office personnel. We booked 2 rooms  and they were all good and clean. Excellent view from the hotel room where you will see the Awana Skyway cable cars in operation  and get excited        
6, Check-in was done within a reasonable time. Deluxe room comes with a nice mountain view. Lots of fresh air and pretty good environment for a relax vacations. Service staff were quite courteous and helpful.             
7, Decided to try this hotel out as a change to my usual preferred hotel  and was pleased with the overall stay. For those who are familiar with tourist hotel  all the hotels on top of  Highlands are interconnected.
8, Entered the spacious and clean lobby  it was very a good way to start the start. However  staffs at reception were not welcoming. Theres a cafe and convenience store at the lobby.
9, Have been going to tourist hotel once every few years and this time was quite disappointing. 
10, Hotel is decent with amenities in place. Not even a single wifi spotted in the hotel room. We had to use it in the lobby or starbucks. Pretty disappointed we were still early for the opening of the extension of tourist hotel.
11, I booked a deluxe room from Sydney for 3 nights paying $45 Australian dollars a night. When we went there - they asked us to do online check-in. We were offered a most filthy room. Room was so small with two single beds.
12, I cant imagine that this hotel does not provide any wifi in room? They only have it at the lobby.. wow.. no wifi?? Hotel Staff at the front desk service was terrible! Unfriendly and not professional at all.
13, I like this hotel very much compare to other hotels. This hotel has wider and bigger rooms than others. The staff of the hotel is very friendly and polite. This hotel is very value for money if there is a promotion available.
14, i liked the hotel ambiance and the lightings in the room. the room temperature is nice as it wasnt so cold. had a pleasant stay and good night sleep. location wise its a little far since we need to go through so many escalators to...             
15, I reserved the stay 10 days before arrival. Arrived at 5:30 pm  by that time my credit card was charged the whole stay already. I booked non smoking room  and I sent a reminder before arriving again. When checked in they gave 11 th floor.
16, I went there to have a bit quiet  but was very noisy. One side the huge blower of AC the other side the road. Was a bit dirty. The staff is unfriendly! The food in the  Cafe is just not good.
17, It was my second time in this hotel and definitely the last time. The hotel is below standards of 3 stars hotels and is disappointed to see this hotel getting same low standards as tourist Hotel. Toilet and rooms are smelly.
18, Less crowded as compare to the other hotels in tourist hotel area as it is a bit hidden away. Large king size bed  reasonable spacious   with two resting chairs  writing table  TV  fridge  coffee making facility  rain shower bath room.   
19, My friend and I had been staying at this hotel almost every month since last year. We like the hotel of the room space and the bed. Its is very comfortable. The only downside is the TV channels not so many to watch.
20, Nice hotel. I think there is a lot of new reception staff. So basically they r not properly train to answer your questions. This hotel is ok and comfortable to sleep  enough space for kids to have fun in the room.
21, Overall experience ok but in the morning around 7am i started to sweat while sleeping i think the Ac was off. Maybe because they thought the weather outside is so cold but in reality it is not.
22, Paid wifi access for guest. Had a huge reception but only few - like 4 to 5 operating counter. Seems to be at least more than ten years old unfurnished structure of the view from cable car. Nice geography curves surrounding the hotel.
23, Room was clean  bathroom was nice and contain transparent glass. No air cond but only fan. But it unexpected that we told by the staff after check out by phone calls around 3pm that the glass of the art has been broke after my stays.
24, Spend one night at this hotel and the room was more spacious than the one at tourist hotel. The hotel is not new though but well maintained and clean. The hotel has a coffee bean and tea leaf cafe at the lobby and check
25, Stayed 1 night 3 rooms. This seems to be the most obvious affordable hotel up there. The rest of the hotels seems to be overpriced. Rooms were surprisingly quite huge and clean. Bed was good. No aircon but the big ceiling fan was more than enough.
26, Stayed 2 nights with connecting rooms. Room is spacious. Toiletries are all provided. Theres also iron and hair dryer. Also a variety of tv channels. Downside is that there is no wifi in the rooms. Wifi is only located at lobby.             
27, Stayed here during weekday so as to avoid the crowd. Fast check in. The room was cozy and much more spacious compared to others. Everything is well maintained. Just that free WIFI is not available.             
28, The hotel is nice  for a night stay up on tourist hotel Highlands. We book this as its newly renovated. The room and bathroom is nice  clean. The services however is not 4 star. They dont help with luggage upon check in  during the stay theres...          
29, The Q at the reception was long and the auto check in machine does not cater to personal request which I submitted when booking through online. I had requested for a non smoking room but the guy at the reception was very slow in allotment.
30, The room is big with all the necessary amenities. It is walking distance to the tourist hotel main casino. Eateries are nearby. The staffs are friendly.   
31, The rooms are good enough for the price and the staff was very helpful especially who gave us connecting rooms. There is no breakfast and gym here. Also no Aircon in the room. Wifi is available only in the lobby. 
32, The rooms are ok try to book it online for good deals from their website. tourist hotel is more cheaper than this one... Yes the lobby of tourist hotel is very good. All hotels on tourist hotel are good. But if u on budget...             
33, The rooms in the hotel are well furnished  clean and with comfortable beds. However  the rooms near the outside concert arena can be very loud at night.
34, The staffs at tourist are really awesome! They are really friendly Have my two-day stay here and it is an awesome experience.          
35, There are a few hotels at tourist hotel. Stayed at the Resort. Checked in was smooth. The hotel room was basic. There was a fan in the room and with open windows you get a nice cool air. Room was situated in a very noisy area.
36, These old hotel still look good to stay. Comfort large bed and clean but furniture look so standard. Equiped with ceiling fan and flat tv  no aircon in room. Bathroom look clean with hot and cold shower.
37, This hotel has the best location compared to other hotels as it is convenient to access different restaurants/theme park. Omly downside was there was only wifi in the lobby which practically does not work. Maybe would consider staying here again. 7/10
38, This hotel was amazing the bathrooms is good and the bed is comfy but the thing that made me give 4 out of 5 is that there is no wifi in the hotel room but there is wifi on the lobby.
39, This is an interesting tour. The road trip is 1 to 2 hours and very interesting with a stop just below the tourist hotel. The rooms were clean and the service lady was really helpful
40, This is one of the Biggest Hotel at tourist hotels. They have big lobby with so many check in counter but still usually for individual customer we should queue. I have stayed so many time at this hotel  but last time i stay here on march.
41, tourist hotel is the place that I having fun  the hotel is very big and have everythings in one place.    
42, Very nice including shopping and good food. It was nice reading about how it started by one person who had visions about this island and now a good tourist attraction where people even go for their honeymoon.
43, We book directly from tourist website. Our family usually go tourist hotel once every 2 - 3 years. tourist we book a twin single bed room. The bed was Super single size. Trip from 17 Sept - 19 Sept 2016.
44, We got 2 connecting rooms which were clean and brightly lit. There is a convenience store and a Coffee Bean at the lobby. The hotel itself is located at a quieter part of tourist hotel which is perfect for a getaway from the noise in the...             
45, we stayed at tourist last month.A very nice centrally located hotel with very helpful staff.The rooms are very spacious and clean.Take a room with even number as they face the Sky Way and nice view of the valley.             
46, We stayed here on 13-15/10/2016. We got a room with hot water supply and no cold water supply. The front desk lady straight away changed our room to a more comfortable room at no charges. It was done so fast. Breakfast also so nice.
47, We stayed in the hotel from 4th to 6th June. We enjoyed the cool weather and natural air-conditioning. The room windows were left open to allow the natural air in. Hotel is linked to many other facilities such as the shopping centre  restaurants.
48, We tried to book a room through a link given by our organiser on August 16  but to no avail. We called  tourist hotel Reservation Line several times  again to no avail. As time is very near the function date  we had no choice.
49, We visited this property in the month of May-2009. Basically we were three couples and stay for two nights there  its good n spacious rooms. breakfast we see how they are going to manage the guest itâ€™s awesome Salute to them.
50, we vist tourist hotel with my friends this wonderful resort biggest hotel at getting excellent mainte. aprox 6800 rooms and big dineg halls pubs and all.
51,"Horrible experience, pathetic service. There was no wifi in the room even after complaining a million times"
52,I loved the stay and will recommend this to my friends. The room was spacious given the price of it.
53,If  you seek slightly more in entertainment and comfort then I suggest you avoid the tourist hotel. The rooms unlike the picture are dirty  stained and reek.
54,The rooms were neat and we liked them so much but The lady at the reception was not at all helpful.
55,The rooms were neat and we liked them so much. The lady at the reception was not at all helpful.
56, I am so angry that i made this post available via all possible sites i use when planing my trips so no one will make the mistake of booking this place I made my booking via booking com We stayed for 6 nights in this hotel from 11 to 17 July Upon arrival we were placed in a small room on the 2nd floor of the hotel It turned out that this was not the room we booked I had specially reserved the 2 level duplex room so that we would have a big windows and high ceilings The room itself was ok if you don t mind the broken window that can not be closed hello rain and a mini fridge that contained some sort of a bio weapon at least i guessed so by the smell of it I intimately asked to change the room and after explaining 2 times that i booked a duplex btw it costs the same as a simple double but got way more volume due to the high ceiling was offered a room but only the next day SO i had to check out the next day before 11 o clock in order to get the room i waned to Not the best way to begin your holiday So we had to wait till 13 00 in order to check in my new room what a wonderful waist of my time The room 023 i got was just as i wanted to peaceful internal garden view big window We were tired from waiting the room so we placed our belongings and rushed to the city In the evening it turned out that there was a constant noise in the room i guess it was made by vibrating vent tubes or something it was constant and annoying as hell AND it did not stop even at 2 am making it hard to fall asleep for me and my wife I have an audio recording that i can not attach here but if you want i can send it via e mail The next day the technician came but was not able to determine the cause of the disturbing sound so i was offered to change the room once again the hotel was fully booked and they had only 1 room left the one that was smaller but seems newer 
57, Rooms are nice but for elderly a bit difficult as most rooms are two story with narrow steps So ask for single level Inside the rooms are very very basic just tea coffee and boiler and no bar empty fridge 
58, My room was dirty and I was afraid to walk barefoot on the floor which looked as if it was not cleaned in weeks White furniture which looked nice in pictures was dirty too and the door looked like it was attacked by an angry dog My shower drain was clogged and the staff did not respond to my request to clean it On a day with heavy rainfall a pretty common occurrence in Amsterdam the roof in my room was leaking luckily not on the bed you could also see signs of earlier water damage I also saw insects running on the floor Overall the second floor of the property looked dirty and badly kept On top of all of this a repairman who came to fix something in a room next door at midnight was very noisy as were many of the guests I understand the challenges of running a hotel in an old building but this negligence is inconsistent with prices demanded by the hotel On the last night after I complained about water damage the night shift manager offered to move me to a different room but that offer came pretty late around midnight when I was already in bed and ready to sleep 
59, You When I booked with your company on line you showed me pictures of a room I thought I was getting and paying for and then when we arrived that s room was booked and the staff told me we could only book the villa suite theough them directly Which was completely false advertising After being there we realised that you have grouped lots of rooms on the photos together leaving me the consumer confused and extreamly disgruntled especially as its my my wife s 40th birthday present Please make your website more clear through pricing and photos as again I didn t really know what I was paying for and how much it had wnded up being Your photos told me I was getting something I wasn t Not happy and won t be using you again 
60, Backyard of the hotel is total mess shouldn t happen in hotel with 4 stars 
61, Cleaner did not change our sheet and duvet everyday but just made bed They also didn t clean the floor and changed the body gel when we run out of it 
62, Apart from the price for the brekfast Everything very good
63, Even though the pictures show very clean rooms the actual room was quit dirty and outlived Also check in is at 15 o clock but our room was not ready at that time
64, The aircondition makes so much noise and its hard to sleep at night 
65, Nothing all great 
66, 6 30 AM started big noise workers loading wood down the windows Stupid room numbering system it took 20 Minutes with a night guard finally to find our rooms The check in staff pointed us in the wrong direction No late dinner bar closes at 1 am Ugly view on trash lorry from windows No information about the computerized telephone Huge price difference between booking Com price 166 euros and hotel price 260 
67, The floor in my room was filfy dirty Very basic rooms I had a 20yr old tv in my room Fridge did not work Overpriced breakfast 
68, The staff in the restaurant could of been more pleasant we only visited once but that wouldn t stop us from booking again it might of just been an off night for him 
69, Very steep steps in room up to the bed not safe for children I asked to move rooms and was put in another identical one Room decoration was minamilist which I like but felt prison cell sparse
70, We did not like the fact that breakfast was not included although you could pay extra for this The room we stayed in was lacking in space a bit and the bathroom was very badly lit to use the mirror in there which meant getting ready for evening a bit tricky but only a small negative comment 
71, We had issues with our electronic key everyday It deactivated It wasn t kept near our phones but somehow there was an issue The staircase for our bed was steep and no handrail The tea coffee facilities weren t updated daily And the floor was dusty and had hair on it and that was upon our arrival That situation didn t change Other than those minor issues the hotel was lovely 
72, Bed was on upper level with a narrow twist staircase No USB port for mobile phone charging not even via thr tv s Some sockets didn t work and had loose covers dangerous Some corridors were poorly lit 
73, Our room was an overrated disaster room 231 dirty smelly hot and very noisy of the banging doors in the corridor and from the other rooms We moved the couch a bid and the dirt and dust of months no cleaning appeared the smell of the gutter was very disturbing the lighting was too weak and a black bathroom is the worst design disaster one can imagine We found the whole hotel dirty dusty and dated To spend more then 243 Euros for a dirty attic room is daylight robbery 
74, Sadly I cannot say that the rooms are clean enough for me When we got in our room we immediately notice there s something wet and sticky like juice or something just next to our bed We called the front desk and they said they will send a cleaning lady to us We waited at least half an hour and no one showed up We had to go to the front desk and complain again When we got back later in the evening the juice has been removed but there s still some hair on the spot We were however no interest to complain anymore Also on the wall in the room on the curtain and in the bathroom there s a lot of stains which I had to ignore the whole time I didn t feel comfortable at all The staff at front desk are very friendly However I guess they pay really bad to their cleaning ladies First you will not be greeted by the cleaning staffs if you run into one at the hallway What more annoying is that I got woke up at 7 in the morning by the cleaning ladies because they closed the doors so loudly when they were cleaning other rooms And they didn t close it loudly just once but for at least on hour They kept open and close the door I was really annoyed I was in my holiday and I just wanted to have a good sleep at least The parking place was small but ok When we arrived the ticket machine was broken Someone told us we don t need a ticket to get in for now and we just have to inform the front desk when we check in We did so and paid for 2 days when we checked out When we drove out the ticket machine was broken again So we didn t actually have to plug in the ticket which we have paid with a lot of money Of course we should pay for it because we parked there but still I was not so happy because I have the feeling that I paid for nothing 
75, Transportation was a bit of a pain but on route to your destination there is amazing views at every corner 
76, The bathroom in our room was a black glass box It theory it s cool in practice it leaves a lot to be desired Little privacy not enough light at the mirror and the shower leaked into the hall It did however allow for a loft space with a desk chairs and a second tv 
77, Nothing at all to do with the Hotel of course but people tend to Slam their bedroom doors as they leave so if you re thinking of having a little lay in just be prepared for a Slam to awake you Other than that nothing to fault at all 
78, Careful they are still renovating the building and start at 8am so it suits for business people but if you want a relaxing stay the noise can annoy you 
79, We had 2 different rooms here and both were duplexes with identical floorplans There was very little space and the staircase was precarious with no handrail Was kind of a pain to have to go downstairs every time we needed something out of our luggage or needed to use the bathroom 
80, There is an ongoing construction enlarging the hotel The hotel s restaurant is nice but overpriced The bathroom is not very practical 
81, Little bit on the pricey side
82, The hotel is going through renovations and unfortunately it means that the rooms can be less than perfect However the staff did recognise those shortcomings and did everything they could to make the stay as agreeable as possible 
83, The room was very big spacious The bath tub was large enough for two people I love the axcess to the from multiple trams and trains The park location was amazing
84, Very nice hotel manager he upgraded us because we had troubles with two different rooms They do everything to make you feel welcome and comfortable The park directly in front of the hotel is amazing rent a bike directly and make a tour Also the bathtub and bed is great 
85, the building meeting rooms modern style of my room park
86, Very nice hotel located in a park Ca 30 minutes by walk to the city center Not typical for Amsterdam since most city hotels are located in small buildings But pay attention to the fact that most of the rooms are two storeyed so you will have to use stairs to get to bed 
87, The location was amazing the room was fantastic east access to public transport set on the lovely Oosterpark lots of places to eat and drink near by or nice walk to the main areas of Amsterdam I would definitely like to stay here again I only had breakfast at the restaurant on site and this was only once and fairly standard as A brit and a connoisseur of cooked breakfasts I was a little disappointed in the hot food but generally lots on offer for everyone just no where does a cooked breakfast like the English but very helpful staff and a nice place to sit with a coffee and start the day and this is the least of any worries due to their being so many good places to eat around and I personally prefer to wander and explore for my dining experiences But not qualified to give a true opinion of the restaurant it was certainly busy in the evenings which suggests its pretty good I will definitely be staying there again if possible the next time i take a trip to Amsterdam
88, Location on the park with easy access to tram lines was very good 
89, The hotel is nicely localted directly within the park which is accessed when walking out of the building The building itself has great history and wonderful architecture The staff is very helpful and friendly when in need of anything 
90, Nice restaurant although felt breakfast was rather expensive at 17 50 per head Location as expected but with hind sight a little further from the main tourist areas than we might have liked but was quite nice to be out of the noisy city centre Staff very courteous 
91, Love the design of the renovated product The park nearby for a walk 
92, Staff were amazing very very friendly and proud of the place they work in The cafe is very cool Will be back
93, The brunch to purchase in the morning was good 
94, The location of the hotel is super opening out to Oosterpark The staff was very helpful and friendly The bed was very comfortable The room was spacious enough for 2 people 
95, Massive bed
96, The hotel looks really impressive Set in a beautiful location The room was clean well decorated and the bed was one of the most comfortable I d ever slept in 
97, The quality of the hotel was brilliant and even though it was under renovation there was no disruption or noise The location of the hotel is far enough away from the centre of the city that it did not feel like a tourist trap and it is also situated in a fantastic park near some great bars and restaurants I cannot fault the staff facilities or the price and would highly recommend this to anyone 
98, clean and new
99, My room was upgraded because they are doing renovations in part of the building The room I was given was enormous and very comfortable I wish I had been staying for a week not just one night 
100, The location and views 
101, The location in a quiet park with a great terrace The space and the rooms are exquisite with a lot of taste The gigantic beds pillows and bedsheets are super comfortable It s dark and silent which is something impossible to find in Amsterdam Staff was very friendly and accommodating The restaurant with a view over the park is great to work and eat
102, Beautiful setting in a lovely park room very spacious clean and comfortable bar area looking over the park was stunning located on the peaceful outskirts of the city but very easy to travel around on the tram system old building with a modern refurbishment it suited us perfectly
103, good and comfortable mattress near tram station helpful people from recepction
104, The hotel is lovely and the staff were amazing They even sorted out booking a meal and taxi for me when I emailed them about this when I first booked online This was such a good idea as we found out after that it was one of the best in town It is set in a park and just looks amazing from the outside and inside is top draw too I would highly recommend 
105, location in the park Cool interior design comfy bed 
106, Location was good but needed tram subway to get to centre of Amsterdam Room was nice but stairs were hard to get up and down to get to bed at night room was clean hotel was nice and modern located in next a lovely park staff were friendly 
107, The location was perfect and so beautiful Only a tram ride from the centre anywhere really 
108, Basically everything The style of the hotel is really great The breakfast is really good good quality food really really nice coffe order from the bar The wifi was good in my room and also throuout the hotel The location is near a metro station its easy to get to the center I loved this hotel honestly and i will stay here again for sure The staff cares that you have a good stay i really liked that Thumbs up from me 
109, The property is beautiful
110, Most of the thing we experience is a very good just keep it up
111, I d booked the trip as a surprise for my partners birthday We got a free room upgrade upon arrival and balloons delivery to the room by the front of house staff to wish him a happy birthday Great staff very welcoming friendly and helpful Lovely room very comfy bed 
112, Location is good They gave me some freebies for noisy room
113, The hotel was fantastic in a lovely setting of a park The hotel itself has been decorated to a very good standard 
114, Great trip staff very friendly
115, Nice open room Bed plenty of room Bath room clean Fridge was a nice touch Easy to get in and out Staff accommodated us fast and politely
116, The breakfast was rather average from quality and appearance and not that well organized The young gentlemen managing this were more interested in watching the young female guests This was nice to see but at the same time spoons butter coffee etc were out I would expect a better experience for that price 
117, Breakfast I missed cutted fresh fruits for Muesli couldn t find the Cheese and for Capuccino you had to pay extra 
118, The sink in the bathroom was very dirty when I got the room Unacceptable The room was freezing cold they could turn on the heating before the guests arrive 
119, upgraded on arrival very good but unfortunately lovely room had a smell of cigarettes mixed with perfume so changed room next room in attic annexe very cold offered a heater but asked to change again back to regular sized room perfectly adequate as on my own and comfortable but bothered by traffic noise from main road outside 
120, If you are staying with someone who you aren t comfortable sharing every little detail with we wouldn t recommend this hotel The glass box in the corner of the room that doubles as the en suite has practically see through glass even though it s black so you can t be concerned about protecting your modesty Nearly all the guests we came across we re British but there was a complete lack of English Breakfast tea in the restaurant where you had breakfast What made it stranger was we told them it was available in the tea coffee facilities in the room but only with powdered milk but they still couldn t produce any for breakfast The hotel was also undergoing serious renovation works at the time Which didn t really affect us other than when they decided to start taking the ceiling of the restaurant down while they were serving breakfast 
121,No Negative
122, The hotel is undergoing massive construction with workers all around and this was not indicated at the time of booking We had a rodent in the room one night due to the disturbance of construction 
123, Rooms were a little louder than we would have liked A lot of noise from people walking by and shutting doors 
124, The hotel is being renovated Which means that you will literally be drilled out of your bed starting at 7am We paid EUR350 for a large room but really it was not worth the money 
125, I can t think of anything that we didn t enjoy 
126, The cleaniness of the rooms can be better Check refrigerator regulary and the rooms can use a good cleaning scrub Also the floor was really sandy and there was an odor in the hallway and room Some extra pillows to watch tv would be nice too Restaurant some nice varpet at the fire place would spice it up And cookies with your tea coffee hot choco it s a star hotel 
127, Wasn t told about renovations going on staff in the restaurant very slow ask to order got told table service then when they did come over were told the restaurant had closed The man covering the night shift wasn t very helpful 
128, The hotel is currently being renovated Being an old building you hear a lot of noise of people walking by your room or in the rooms above Mini Bar empty No remote for the TV Heating direct above the bed and quite noisy 
129, Initial room was small but we were quickly swapped into a bettet room without fuss
130, That I wasn t told about the refurbishment so when we arrived i had told my girlfriend after a long tiring day it was a beautiful hotel which when we got there was covered in building works We had to walk through a temporary wood tunnel had no milk in our room for refreshments When walking around there was nobody very empty feel 
131, Maintenance work on facade of hotel no advance warning and some rather inadequate drinks token to make up for it Leaking air con above bed was noisy and was dripping Stained carpet Not very safe feeling a steep staircase to the sleeping area with no barrier from 2 3m high Not much useful information No minibar Understaffed reception long wait 
132, No ground floor room as requested 2 months ago first room totally freezing etc restaurant under par Much better last time we stayed Prices gone up 
133, We booked 3 twins and were given 2 and a double which they couldn t change Not happy Plus bathroom had a horrible smell coming from the drain 
134, Even allowing for the hotel being under major renovation works the quality of service leaves a lot to be desired Noise of running water coming from the heating system disturbed our sleep considerably No remediation possible Toiletries in bathroom had been used by previous guests Some were empty some partially used Checkout at 12 30 1hour after official checkout time was declined as priority is given to a tour group arriving earlier than normal checkin time Having paid over 300 for 1 night stay this is somewhat disappointing Service at breakfast was very poor Shabby state of hotel with the exception of the rooms is perhaps explained by the renovation works and work still to be done 
135, The room was tall narrow and small with an integral bathroon Having a shower steamed up the room and soaked the floor as the glass shower panels did not have any doors to stop water going everywhere 
136, In a terrible state with builders everywhere We had to wait to get into our room as the conference event builders were blocking the door Our room that we were told was new was in a poor state of repair 
137, So lets start from the weird thing that happened in one of the rooms we were staying One person in our group got 220v electric chock which went through her hands It came from water boiler or lamp due to either a bad wireing faulty socket lamp or water boiler Luckily the rooms fuse discharged and cut the electricity in the room immediately The hotel covered doctor expences were very sorry about what had happened and send a fruit basket to a room They also let us have a late check out for free of charge Thats all of the compensation we had In my opinion the compensation was not that big for endangering a life of guest or what do you think The managemt had a chance to read and comment my review before i posted it The hotel management answered that this electric problem is now fixed but its still unclear if they checked other renovated rooms for faulty wireing too It anyway seems that the management does not worry about this that much since the management said that they did nor endanger any lives in the hotel Ofcource the managent was also very sorry in the answer about what had happened Some information gaps there seemed to be between the manager and the personnel since the cleaner came to ask us when are we leaving and the keys stopped working before the time we had been granted to leave Picture is from bathroom lamp that had nothing to do with the insident but such wireing was visible in the rooms
138, There were Construction Works and such information was not passed to us when we booked There was dust everywhere and the shower was blocked the bathroom flooded everytime we took a shower Too dark common reas 
139, The work being done externally right now is off putting on arrival Will look great once finished but we did get free drinks to compensate 
140, Our room was a little compact probably due to it being a loft room at the end of the building However the design tried to maximise its quirky layout 
141, Got charged 50 for a birthday package when it was advertised for 30 on the website This was apparently due to city taxes which we were unaware of The shower was blocked and would flood the room after one use We were unable to get rid of the water so couldn t use the room after we d had a shower Couldn t check us into our room at 3pm had to wait extra 30 minutes Standard Breakfast was very expensive at 17 I highly suggest not to buy Cigarette machine was broken and staff still allowed us to try and use Overall a disappointing stay for a birthday weekend 
142, split level bedrooms although quirky are impractical 1 TV remote for both tv s but on differernt floors A C is located downstairs so very impractical to have to go downstairs to adjust The walls are also very thin not good sound proofing 
143, Building work starting at 7am waking us up no mention of building work on booking com and on hotels web page it does say renovations but not that there would be noise disturbance Also air conditioning very very loud
144, Hotel is having some construction work done this I can live with the tables and general cleanliness of the restaurant was not 4 star all the surfaces were sticky and full of old food the room had a very narrow and steep staircase to get to the bed really difficult to come down I thought
145, There was a girl working in the restaurant and we asked her a few things about the dessert but she didn t know alot The staff that evening didn t walk by our table once and when they did they didn t take our plates The staff the next day though was more experienced and very outgoing So our dinner of the night before was immediately forgotten and we had a great night at your restaurant 
146, it s a shame about all the construction going on because it looked like such a beautiful place but we couldn t see a lot 
147, Building work is being done but it doesn t case any hassle 
148, Construction during the day though not intrusive
149, The front desk staff particularly the young men tended to be a bit spaced out and were not very helpful at times however the female attendants on the desk were quite efficient and knowledgeable Breakfast was a bit pricey especially for two people combined 
150, No Limited A C in common areas Dangerous metal ornaments on all banisters Musty smell throughout common areas Deluxe rooms very small impractical design Impractical shower design no place for soap Poor quality bed mattress Room refrigerator barely worked Food in restaurant overprices only fair quality Overall dark rundown dreary appearance
151, There was a loud noise outside my room on the first night like a generator Perhaps it had to do with the renewal works in place 
152, The hotel is under reconstruction although it didn t affect us Overall it s a lovely hotel very spacious 
153, there is a renovation ongoing in front of the hotel which will hopefully be completed soon as it kills the view
154, Staff promised things they didn t deliver Room was very small bathroom cramped location generally distant 
155, We would have liked to know in advance that the hotel is being renovated We had a room right in front of the building site and were waken up at 6 30 because of the noise Booking com should warn travellers for this so they can ask for a room on the quiet side of the hotel 
156, I wouldnt be able to recommend my grandparents as there are stairs in our room i also dont remember reading that there are stairs in the room although its fine for us as we are only 20 
157, The outside of the hotel is under construction It will look beautiful when it s done 
158, the room next to us were quite loud at night time which proved it a bit difficult to sleep on times The bathroom was really damp due to the wet room and water went by the toilet so we had to wear shoes when using the bathroom after showering The staff member who checked us in charged us a 150 security fee and we were told that this would not be deducted from our bank only held but it was which resulted into the bank blocking my card due to an unauthorised foreign payment Check this when checking in and make sure the bank is aware 
159, The hotel gardens and patios were under major renovation The sidewalk entrance was a mess There was no mention of this at all on the booking com website We were given a voucher for one drink cocktails excluded as compensation Not good enough 
160, Major construction work underway next door as part of hotel expansion Room on 2 levels with very steep staircase which made going to the toilet in the night a very dangerous experience After complaining they did agree to move us to room on one level Food in restaurant leaves a lot to be desired for anyone wishing to have food anything except medium rare Despite friendly staff will not be returning cannot recommend 
161, The first room had steep steps to a loft bed Not practical and dangerous for someone 68 especially if he has to go to the bathroom in the night Second night had a room on one level 
162, The bathroom has cristal walls and it is not comfortable at all The room size was also pretty small 
163, Our suite on the 3 floor was beautiful but our mattress probably old was slumping in the middle The staff could not provide a board to put under to make it better and at the time there was no other suite available though smaller rooms were offered For the price you would have expected at least a comfortable bed
164, The shower was useless and when it worked it soaked the entire bathroom meaning we had to use all our towels to dry the floor was a disaster The room wasn t cleaned properly in a long time just cleaning round the edges The bed room was up a slight set of stairs which left it very warm because we were along way form the window which left the room stuffy and over heated having to go up and down stairs that were dangerous to the toilet or to get a drink was a nightmare The stairs are dangerous and narrow wouldn t be suitable for older people or kids You definitely get what you pay for It was half clean and not very central
165, Overpriced breakfast Bed too soft Bath had no shelf to leave bottles etc on Building works impact on overall good impression 
166, We were upgraded which was lovely but the heating didn t work and the room was cleaned once in 3 days We had to ask for more towels We ordered two burgers which were disgusting and the meat smelled bad after 3 mouthfuls my friend was sick 
167, We did have what looked like blood splashes all up the top of our curtains Told reception but nothing was done about it It definitely didn t put us of our stay and wouldn t stop us going back 
168, The bathrooms only had smoked glass walls which did not provide as much privacy as we are used to The lighting in the halls was too dim 
169, We had one of our items we bought taken possibly mistaken as rubbish even though this wasn t in the bin no where near the bin and next to other gifts we bought We told reception but nothing came of it Very disappointing as this made us feel our other belonging where not safe in the hotel from there on 
170, Two storey room with narrow winding stairs Wet room d cor and functionality Lack of storage space
171, There was a staircase in our room between the bed and the bathroom This means the bathroom is very spacious and lovely but can be a bit of a pain in the middle of the night 
172, It would have been nice if the one responsible for the cleaning of the room had swept up the crumbs from the floor It was noisy from the main street It was not heated floor in the bathroom and as it rained pretty much during our stay it was difficult with wet shoes There was construction site all around the hotel and the choice would have fell on another hotel if we had known this I am sure it will be very nice when it is finished 
173, First impressions of the dark reception made us wary to begin with Also we were given a duplex suite to start with Dutch stairs are very steep and we asked to change rooms which staff were most accommodating about The hotel is being renovated externally but this didn t affect our stay at all 
174, Foyer was a mess Only place to relax was the bar and that was not comfortable enough to stay for more than a drink or two We had a very cold spell and it was draughty The first room whilst ok for a honey moon couple was totally unacceptable for any one over 30 or afraid of hights The second room was huge cold and paint in need of repair The hotel states it is four star but is not It feels like a up graded backpackers It is basic clean no frills or comfort three star max I thought I was booking a comfortable picturesque hotel it felt like and old school building we later found out that is exactly what it it was The hotel was under going major re constructions to the foyer entrance area nothing was mentioned at time of booking It was very disappointing and embarrassing as I had also made the booking for our friends who we were travelling with Very expensive hotel with nothing to make up for the expensive rooms 
175, the club sandwiches cold bacon with congealed fat and processed chicken Very poor 
176, The staff were very friendly and helpful and our room was amazing the bed was really big and so comfy 
177, Great room great staff great food 
178, Food in restaurant Quirky place use to be a hospital Reasonably convienent for transport into city centre Beautiful park beside hotel Walk through to other side for some nice cafe basrs for breakfast 
179, Beds were comfy the bar staff and reception staff were very helpful when we asked to move rooms
180, Beautiful gothic hotel Very good location Some nice bars and restaurants Fabulous Thai restaurant 5 minutes away 3 metro stops from Dam centre Really enjoyed staying there There was building work ongoing but you would never have know 
181, The whole experience was amazing there were construction works going on but the staff made sure it didn t impact your time there at all very friendly and very helpful
182, Room was lovely we got a free upgrade Bathroom fab Excellent breakfast Nice sitting out area for those who wished to smoke Reception and dining bar staff exceptionally nice 
183, Quiet location and thankfully the construction to the exterior of the hotel did not impact our stay 
184, Very comfortable bed and cool hotel
185, Hotel was very clean and staff helpful Very trendy and reasonably priced
186, The bed was huge and comfortable Massively high ceilings and the feature staircase 
187, Staff were very friendly helpful The kitchen provided us a great meal the bar staff were nice and the breakfast bar was very impressive 
188, The style of the room was unique and amazing with a light room laminate floors and a stunning black bathroom Our kingsize was very comfy and spacious The hotel itself is very beautiful and they have kept the original staircases and high ceilings All of the staff spoke English perfectly just like most people in the city and I couldn t fault them on anything they were always willing to answer our questions and even gave us a map and told us where we could find some interesting places Hotel Arena s location is pretty perfect as it is less than a 10 minute walk from a tram stop to Centraal Dam Square Rembrandtplein and any other places you might be interested in exploring It s also right next to Oosterpark so I can imagine how nice it would be to go to in the spring and upcoming summer Really loved this place overall and a great hotel to stay at especially if it is your first time in Amsterdam as it was mine 
189, Location was great for us as was close to my sister there was always someone on the desk the bars were lovely the building was impressive but building work going on which we didn t know about but I m sure it will look amazing Really funky room 
190, The bed was super cosy The staff was nice The hotel isn t central but if you get bikes it s very close and easy to cycle 
191, Staff were fantastic and changed our overall view of the hotel Got off to a bad start room 240 was tiny and they changed us No argument Bar staff and reception staff really friendly and pleasant 
192, Cool hotel great receptionist who gave us ideas of what to do in Amsterdam delicious supper at the hotel And great shower 
193, Bar and restraint staff were great reception was a bit lacklustre Also th bathroom walls are completely see through Wouldn t advise number 2 s if you are sharing a room 
194, The staff was very nice and friendly the size of the room was really great and the style of the hotel is also very nice The bed was quite confortable 
195, Average good accommodation Big room Helpful staff Room cleaned daily Big hot shower Comfy bed 
196, The only good thing about this hotel is the friendly staff and the way it looks Considering they have work going on Location is great 5mins walk to tram stop n your in damn square in 10mins Also we bought 3 day travel ticket from the train station for 25 euros n the hotel sell this for 17 50 euros so buy from hotel it s cheaper Trains are not included in the hotel travel card but u won t need trains if your staying in dam Only to and from airport

204, The room was exactly as expected The bed was the most comfortable bed that we have ever slept on the shower was HUGE Easy check in and check out only a 5 minute walk to the grocery store staff were very friendly and public transport is only minutes walk from the hotel room or if you like walking everything you need to see is only a 30 45min walk

211, The hotel is amazing Beautiful interior We weren t disrupted by the work going on as the place is sound proof Our room was fantastic the only thing I should have done was ask for a fan at reception because the room temperature was too hot and the air con wouldn t go below 21oc The room layout with the bedroom upstairs was lush

229, Very smart room good food 
230, Breakfast Staff
231, staff helpful but maybe because of building upheaval hotel history and architecture a real treat would stay again try another room and see the hotel when fully refurbished possibly have a discount due to the visit being in middle of a bulding site and not as expected when booked 
232, The hall
233, Nice staff good rooms with separate little living room and bedroom did not experience any problems with the reconstruction

237, Close to Tram Excellent room nice staff 
238, Good Wi fi 
239, Good location next to the tram but is under going a major revamp No noise problem but the lovely garden is gone Sill good value for money This is a big place lovely old building 
240, The best thing at this price excellent price in relation to the modern and spacious room received 
241, Character of the hotel was great Location was good
242, Hotel and rooms were beautiful My friend and I wanted some luxury on our trip to Amsterdam and this hotel provided just that The staff were extremely friendly and gave us lots of advice on where to go local life etc You will need to get trams metro from this hotel which all added to the experience of our trip Would definitely recommend this hotel 
243, The staff were extremely polite and helpful i honestly couldn t fault them The room itself was clean and comfortable and the location was great 
244, friendly staff place is very clean and charming beautiful restaurant and bar food looked I didn t try it way better than the usual Amsterdam culinary sins
245, This was our first time in Amsterdam and the staff were incredibly helpful They took special notice of the fact that is was my birthday and were so friendly 
246, Great location lovely room
247, Very nice property stylish hotel friendly staff spacious rooms except the one with stairs and close to the city center just a couple of stops by tram 
248, Boutique atmosphere good size rooms with comfortable beds and stylishly designed bathrooms 
249, It was a well kept hotel in a lovely area The staff and services offered were excellent We felt it was a great value Our beautiful room with a view was a bonus 
250, The hotel is beautiful the pictures here arent doing it justice at all right on Oosterpark which is awesome The location is great walking distance to the tram public transport to anywhere and 5 10 mins to POI convenience shops and small local bars on the quieter part of the city You can also get to the city center by walking but it will take about 20 30mins Very clean room made and towels changed everyday Almost perfect 
251, Crews being nice and helpful Environment quiet and peaceful but unfortunately certain areas under construction 
252, The bathroom and sofa are so good The building style is really awesome 
253, We liked the location and the extra pleasant staff They were very accommodating to our requests e g extra towels and specialty pillows 
254, I loved the hotel design and decoration Staff were extremely nice always helpful and smiling That is something you really appreciate when you are on a 24 hour business trip Breakfast was way better than I expected although coffee was quite bad That is something most hotels fail to nail and I think most guests find it important Rooms are fantastically cozy clean and comfortable 
255, The bed was comfy and large The wifi was fast and good Separate living area Powerful shower
256, Got in late and hadn t eaten 24 hour pizza delivery offered at front desk brilliant at 12pm friendly staff and wifi in room hotel is 15 mins walk from dam square nice to be away from the hussle and bussle in town

258, Really enjoyed our stay at hotel arena staff were fab made us feel really welcome even made us a coffee at 6am whilst waiting fir our taxi to the airport
259, The matress and pillows were exceptionally good Best sleep in terms of comfort ever I would be grateful to know your suppliers as would like to replicate this comfort in my own home 
260, Although the hotel is a little from the main centre the hotel itself was outstanding The hotel is currently under construction and expanding its capacity and restaurant bar space I was shocked when we arrived to see a construction site but you couldn t hear any building work from the room and the hotel was impeccable inside Fantastic value for money but I assume once the construction has been completed the hotel will be one of the top places to stay in Amsterdam The bar and restaurant is an added bonus to the hotel and the staff were pleasant and polite The hotel is spectacular and the rooms are modern and very comfortable the previous reviews regarding the bathroom walls are true but we didn t find that an issue I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone especially for the location as many trams lead to the centre of Amsterdam in only 7 10 minutes 
261, Great bed bathroom beer garden decor staff and food 
262, This is a fantastic place to stay and felt like true luxury despite the amazingly cheap price that we paid for our stay There is work going on at the moment but we were given free drinks which were delicious and would both love to return to see the hotel when all the work is finished as it is such a fantastic place to stay that is steeped with history Also the shower was incredible 
263, We loved our stay at hotel arena The hotel was great Staff was really kind especially for Job the guy encharged of the restaurant and Sander the guy who recieved us in the front desk Talking to them it came up in the conversation that my boyfriend and I got engaged the day before arriving to the hotel That night when we got to our room there was a great bottle of champagne and a beautiful congratulations card waiting for us un our room It was a very classy detail We were so thankful about it Also beds and pillows were great the breakfast boufett awesome and i woukd also recommend to have at least one dinner at the hotels restaurant Food is great Thank u for everything hotel arenaaa 
264, Everything The friendly staff super comfortable bed we did not want to get out of bed in the morning it was so comfortable the artsy decor of the hotel chic bar It was truly pleasant to stay in Hotel Arena

274, Very comfortable big bed Free wi fi Lovely building and interior

276, I loved the room There was so much space spanning two floors The staff were super friendly and gave us great advice on locations to visit during our stay in Amsterdam 
277, Friendly staff nice rooms comfy bed though pillows aren t as comfy as they look There are two trams that leave from close to the hotel and one goes directly to Central and both go to the main tourist hub Oosterpark right on your door step
278, location outside terras

324, The room layout was not smart 
325, Main room floor wasn t cleaned
326, Insonorisation was not the best Could hear rowdy neighbors at night 
327, Cleaning small rooms Too expensive
328, The mattress was awful 
329, Transparentes WC Bad
330, slightly out of the city walkable and had an easy tram ride 
331, Long walk from the city center
332, A little far from centre breakfast is quite expensive
333, The shower didnt have a door so the floor got wet
334, The hotel was situated a little too far out of town 
335, One gruff check in member
336, It s a all round good hotel
337, Expensive to get to from the train station airport
338, Doors to the bathroom
339, Really nothing negative to say about this hotel
340, No coffee or tea in the room or lobby No one to help with our bags from Tax into the Hotel No handicapped access At 80 years old it was very difficult for me to lug two large suit cases up the 12 oursidestairs and then up into the lobby 
341, Room was pretty small for the three of us 
342, Only cab service to airport is expensive compared to others 48 pounds plus tip 
343, London hotel rooms are very small There was very little storage Would have liked to have some drawers however small for storage 
344, The room for three people was on the small side 
345, Room wasn t ready on arrival after travelling from Leeds to London and phoning 2hours away to reserve parking Rude receptionist to girlfriend about parking as it wasn t our fault someone had taken our space We arrived at 16 00 and our room wasn t ready so was given a complimentary drink each and half an hour later still wasn t ready and being told it would be a further 40minutes Just wasn t good enough as we were only staying for 1 night and had a concert to go to 
346, Our room allocated wasn t up to our expectations bathroom was to small when you opened bathroom door you banged into the toilet We had to require a different room at an extra cost of 30 a night 
347, The cooked elements of breakfast could have been better but the continental selection was very good 
348, The room was a lot smaller than advertised I requested a room on the top floor was originally put on the 2nd floor They changed me to a room on the top floor only to find out at 1am that the room had previous electrical issues that they knew about which hadn t been resolved and caused a loud knocking noise Once reported to the front desk I was asked to move rooms at 1am No assistance was offered Second room was slightly larger than the first but not by much I thought the breakfast was a good quality but pretty overpriced Beds were rather stiff but not entirely uncomfortable I didn t find the staff very friendly They weren t mean they just didn t seem very keen on being pleasant bad day maybe The gym is not worth calling a gym Has some meager cardio equipment no real ventilation no tv 
349, Lower ground floor room L01 possibly the smallest bathroom I ve ever stayed in awful View from Windows not inspiring to see the rat traps outside Won t go back 
350, Dimensions of the room small But I m was a single room and Erls court London The space cost money as a traditional London hotel
351, Squeaky floors Difficult to go to the bathroom at night without waking my husband Also 4th floor our window didn t open to the outside 
352, Not once during our four day stay including when we arrived to check in did any staff member speak to us before being spoken to first We were the only guests in the reception area when we checked in Not one single welcome good morning or hello in four days And we were not disgruntled or asking for any special requirements It was a very nice property but that indifferent attitude was a striking difference from every other small hotel and B B in which we stayed on this three week UK vacation We would not recommend K K Hotel George nor would we return ourselves 
353, The hotel only support to call their contracted taxi which is expensive and unsafe when we paid by credit card they have no cashier mashine in the car instead they called the back office we had to tell them our credit card no expire month and the security no through the mobile phone this is very riskful for us The hotel should improve their taxi service raise the safety requirement to their contracted taxi company 
354, The front desk staff was not very informed regarding city happenings or tips Fortunately I could rely on the internet to answer more specific questions Additionally I was not entirely confident that they understood the questions I was asking in English 
355, Staff not very friendly Did their job but seldom smiled or made one feel welcomed 
356, Room size too small and it was too hot Our window was too small and It good lighting We stayed on the 4th floor and I believ that room should not be used but perhaps converted to a larger room or storage since the lighting was poor from this awkward size window Breakfast was ok but they started taking things away and cleaning while we were still there 
357, The room was a little stuffy They didn t have AC on yet Probably too early in the season Shower sometimes went hot and then cold 
358, The shower temperature was changing all the time from freezing to boiling and back 
359, choice of food in bar wasn t too good but there are lots of great places to eat nearby so there was no problem 
360, The fact the windows don t open and the room was hot and stuffy and the bed was hard it was necessary to switch heating off put aircon on maximum and then of course it was noisy and even so there was no fresh air which is essential
361, The rooms are very small we had trouble fitting 2 suitcases in The price is fairly high even by London s standards and breakfast was extra 
362, The room is a little small and the decor is dated 
363, Air con seemed to be set on winter warmer but easily resolved switched it off and opened window simples 
364, We needed gluten free breakfast and ordered it beforehand but the serving was not safe The toasts were but nothing else not The table was set up in the way that cross contamination was difficult to avoid Also bacon eggs and potato cakes were cooked in the same oven and served together Potato cakes had gluten including flours They seemed to have no idea what exactly it all means to serve safe gluten free food 
365, breakfast the same everyday not much options but good and clean fitness center has one machine and they call fitness center small rooms 
366, Breakfast was crowded at times and the selection of food was ok but not great 
367, Rooms could be updated that being said everything is functional and very clean 
368, Bed was too soft bathroom a wee bit small for manoeuvring in 
369, The wifi is only 500kb s which isn t fast by today s standards The power socket near the bed was loosen I can t charge my phone 
370, We were put in a basement room which certainly wouldn t have classed as a 4 star room How ever it was clean and bed was comfortable 
371, Wifi is ridiculously slow and fiddly to connect using Chrome Breakfast coffee was only average
372, We choose to personally take our laundry to be cleaned as it was 1 10 th of the cost of what the hotel was going to charge this was very excessive The room was very warm but we managed by keeping the windows and drapes open 
373, Not convinced that solo travellers are treated with the same consideration as others for room location in the hotel in particular
374, Top floor rooms were so small had to leave one suitcase in the car as unable to fit it in Rooms very hot and had to have windows open in sub zero temperatures Shower over bath tub was dangerously erratic with cold water rapidly displaced by scalding water and no non slip mat or stickers in bath Lethal combination for the elderly or children Second room key not allowed by the hotel s security so had to call reception to let us in if separated Front desk staff very dismissive 
375, The breakfast staff were not helpful When we went for breakfast the restaurant was busy and we were asked to wait about 5 minutes to be seated They forgot about us and we had to approach them about our table After 25 minutes we were finally seated I was so upset I did not have a breakfast and left the restaurant in disgust at our treatment We won t be back
376, couldn t work out how to crank DOWN the heating in the room Bathroom is miniscule Mini bar was very limited with its choice
377,No Negative
378, Breakfast is expensive especially when I have already paid over 90 for a standard room per night 
379, mistake over payments and noise due to creaky floorbords Also It would ve been nice if we were told beforehand that a 60 euros deposit would be required regarding potential mini bar consumptions When we refused to comply the person in charge told us curtly that our mini bar shall be emptied fothwith 
380, The only thing I can think of is that i would have preferred not to have a wall to wall carpet in the room but it seemed clean so it was no big deal 
381, I had to ask at breakfast all 3 mornings we were there for coffee and re fills I think it would be better to have coffee on the buffet as you could just help yourself like you could with tea
382, My one complaint is the overly soft mattresses It was not good for my back 
383, The mattress wasn t comfortable and the pillows were way too soft I had a neck ache the next morning The room was super tiny We stayed at the Hilton Bankside and the room was so spacious in comparison 
384, Temperature in the room was difficult to regulate 
385, I don t know if it was because I booked through Booking com but seemed to get the worst room in the place Underground with no view Unable to book breakfast for second day at the reduced price as I should have done it on check in I didn t know what I was going to be doing on check in Tea and biscuits not replenished the second day 
386, Really nothing this was a perfect choice 
387, Rooms are not heated may be an issue in very cold winters Gym is open from 4 00 pm to 10 00pm when you usually are out 
388, Soiled chair in room Pillows not clean Shower temp control very sensitive in 1st room we stayed in Value for money
389, We asked for 2 singles and a sofa bed but were given a double bed and no explanation There were few accessible plugs for hair straighteners and the like and the hair dryer didn t work To be fair we didn t take this up with the hotel so they may have sorted this if asked to do so 
390, No Iron and ironing board and maybe a few sachets of hot chocolate in the room nothing really to complain about 
391, Did book a twin bedded room and got a very large double so it didn t matter too much Loo very low lucky I am only 5ft 2 
392, Staff not particularly helpful Have stayrf before and not had room serviced so had to request this 3 times Breakfasy ok but not outstanding for a 4 Rooms small esp bathroom and not particularly warm
393, Housekeeping missed my room one day and although I did not make much of a fuss over it I did not get a convincing explanation I did get an apology though 
394, room wasn t ready was upgraded but had to pay for a drink while we waited
395, bathroom is really small
396, Staff could ve been a bit more clued up failed to check my booking room assigned was not what I asked for I requested a double and on entering the room was given a twin So was offered a double in the lower ground it didn t smell very pleasant in the room and the mattresses need to be changed I was advised I had been upgraded This was probably due to the error made on check in however even though the room may have been bigger there were no extras in the room and the TV was much smaller Clearly not an upgrade I don t know I guess for 135 I was expecting a lot more for a 1 night stay On checking in I was asked to pay for breakfast as its more expensive on the day yet it was already part of the rate I didn t have the best start to staying here unfortunately And not even a helping hand with my bag considering the error of assigning me the wrong room laid with the hotel breakfast could ve been more fresh and hotter Appreciate I had arrived 25mins before it closed yet it was still in the valid timeset 
397, Weird atmosphere in reception many eastern European staff Room Cold and uninspiring 4 per drink of cheap orange juice mixed with tap water Overpriced overall
398, Front desk night manager charged my bill in dollars without permission He tried to net an extra 40 on my bill with the horrible exchange rate When I caught it he told me I must have authorized it at check in which I had not Completely unacceptable 
399, The towel in the bathroom had blood on it and it wasn t our blood so disgusting Also we had a room below the pavement at the front of the hotel with a lot of noise from foot traffic and their conversations 
400, The gym facility is pointless make sure you go elsewhere if you want to use the gym
